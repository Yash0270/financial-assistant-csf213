# Application Requirements 

### Key Technologies Used  

#### Frontend
The front of the system is made with HTML and CSS along with JavaScript. HTML is the primary market language and CSS is used for markup design, and Javascript is used to implement dynamic elements.

#### Backend
The backend relies on Ruby as its core object oriented language, which supports an MVC framework. MVC stands for Model-View-Controller. It divides the application into three interconnected parts, so as to separate internal representations of information from the ways that information is presented to or accepted from the user.

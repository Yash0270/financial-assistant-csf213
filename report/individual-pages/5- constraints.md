# Constraints and Assumptions

1. The user has an access to a web browser for connecting to the application
2. The application cannot be deployed on a windows system, hence, Ubuntu 17.10 is used. However, it can be accessed from any system.
3. The present hardware does not allow for a large number of users. We assume no more than 100 users access the applicaton simultaneously. This constraint can be overcome by deploying the application on a cloud server.
4. There is no system for the user to get notified of the events or tasks that he has created.

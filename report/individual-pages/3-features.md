# Features
The following is a tentative list of all the features in the application.

### 1. Events
As the name suggests, Events are objects created by the user that are displayed on the dashboard in the form of a calendar. Events are allowed to have priorities, which is represented in the form of color coding the events. A date and time is associated with the event. Events can span multiple days.

### 2. Finance Management
The application contains a comprehensive finance mangement system. User can add bank accounts, update their balances, create a budget,list the spends, and add any information about the influx of money. The dashboard provides the user with a summary of the current financial statement and details can be found in the finance tab.

### 3. Notes
Notes are there for the user to jot down information to be accessed later. Notes can be clubbed together in the form of groups.

### 4. To do Lists
To do lists are in the form of checklists, each item can contain many subitems and they have priority ordering. We use Kanban Board to help the user manage their tasks.
